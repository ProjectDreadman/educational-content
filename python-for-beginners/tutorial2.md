# Python Basics

## Conditional Statements

Python uses conditional statements to perform different actions based on different conditions.

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```
## Loops
Python provides two types of loops: "for" and "while".
```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
## Functions
Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task.
```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```
